# Hello, blog  

This is the very first post I'm making.

For now the site is very crude, but it will improve over time️ ♥️.

## About

This was my first time making a site with a site generator, I picked [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), along the way I learned about [SaaS](https://sass-lang.com/), [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/).
